    These metrics provide a quantitative summary of the model's performance. An R-squared score of 0.81 indicates that 
    81% of the variance in the actual grades is explained by our model, which is relatively high. The MSE and MAE values 
    suggest that, on average, our predictions deviate slightly from the actual values, with the model having a small 
    margin of error. The relatively low MAE indicates that the absolute errors are minimal, suggesting that the model

    The model performs well overall, as shown by the R-squared score and the alignment between the predicted and 
    actual values in the visualization. However, some discrepancies remain, particularly in areas where the predicted 
    grades diverge slightly from the actual grades. The relatively low MSE suggests that larger errors (outliers) are 
    minimized, while the low MAE indicates that the model is accurate across most data points. The model’s performance 
    may stem from its ability to capture linear relationships in the data, but limitations could arise if the underlying 
    relationship is non-linear or if there are influential outliers.

    """
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was chosen to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. By transforming 
    high-dimensional data into a smaller set of principal components, PCA helps retain the most important features 
    while minimizing redundancy. This approach not only speeds up model training but can also improve model 
    generalization by removing noise and irrelevant features. Given that our dataset had multiple features, PCA 
    allowed us to focus on the primary patterns in the data, making the model more interpretable and efficient.

    st.markdown("**Why Linear Regression was Chosen:**")

    """
    Linear Regression was selected as it is a straightforward and interpretable model that works well for 
    predicting continuous outcomes. Since our goal was to predict student grades, which can be viewed as a 
    continuous variable, Linear Regression provided a direct approach to understand and predict grade trends 
    based on input features. Additionally, Linear Regression often performs well when there is a linear 
    relationship between features and the target variable. This simplicity also allowed us to more easily 
    interpret the results and explain the influence of different features on the outcome.
